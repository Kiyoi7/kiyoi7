### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Thanks for stopping by and giving the readme a read.

I am taking the time to start self studying a plethora of complex topics to prepare myself for building these technical skills. Did have a class that used Git and Github a little bit years ago but life happened. 

At the moment, I plan to use the space here to practice web development as my main priority  Second on the list is game development. I had this idea for an action-platformer game for a while. Hopefully I can get the ball rolling on that one even though this is a new experience for me.

The amount I have to learn is mountainous, so I'm taking it a step at a time.

I'll make a few more updates soon with other fun tidbits, ideas, and projects. 

Oh yeah and understanding how other users network with each other is on the to-do list.
