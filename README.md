### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by and giving the readme a read.

I am taking the time to start self studying a plethora of complex topics to prepare myself for building these technical skills. 
Did have a class that used Git and Github a little bit years ago but life happened. 

At the moment, I plan to use the space here to practice web development as my main priority. 
Second on the list is game development. These two are likely going to be the bulk of my projects. 
I had this idea for an action-platformer game for a while. 
Hopefully I can get the ball rolling on that one even though this is a new experience for me.

The amount I have to learn is mountainous, so I'm taking it a step at a time.

My main hobby is gaming, so that is typically what I'll likely talk about in conversation during my free time.
There are games from many different genres that I enjoy, but my top 3 are generally RPGs, Platformers, and Strategy. 

Oh yeah and understanding how other users network with each other is on the to-do list.
